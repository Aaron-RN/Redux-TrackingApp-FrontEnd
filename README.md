In order for this application to work you will also need to setup your back-end server. You can do so following this readme guide [here](https://github.com/Aaron-RN/ROR-TrackingApp-API/tree/models-controllers).

### Setting up Front-End to Back-End connection

After you have successfully setup your back-end, you will need to change the URL the front-end connects to.

1. Navigate to your local directory of this cloned repository
2. Navigate to the src/redux/actions folder and open the index.js file
3. On line 3 where you would see const ```const URL = 'https://arn-tracking-app-api.herokuapp.com/';```, replace ```'https://arn-tracking-app-api.herokuapp.com/'``` with the url of your back-end server that you would have setup following the ["Setting up The Back-End"](https://github.com/Aaron-RN/ROR-TrackingApp-API/tree/models-controllers) Guide

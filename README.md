### [Setting up BackEnd](https://github.com/Aaron-RN/ROR-TrackingApp-API/tree/models-controllers)

In order for this application to work you will also need to setup your backEnd server. You can do so following this readme guide [here](https://github.com/Aaron-RN/ROR-TrackingApp-API/tree/models-controllers).

After you have successfully setup your backEnd, you will need to change the URL the frontEnd connects to.

1. Navigate to your local directory of this cloned repository
2. Navigate to the src/redux/actions folder and open the index.js file
3. On line 3 where you would see const ```const URL = 'https://arn-tracking-app-api.herokuapp.com/';```, replace ```'https://arn-tracking-app-api.herokuapp.com/'``` with the url of your backEnd server that you would have setup following the ["Setting up The BackEnd"](https://github.com/Aaron-RN/ROR-TrackingApp-API/tree/models-controllers) Guide
